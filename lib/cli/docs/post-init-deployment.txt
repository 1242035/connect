Your Anvil Connect deployment repository is initialized. Next steps:

1. Install npm dependencies if you plan to run the server locally.

      $ npm install
      $ bower install

2. Adjust your configuration files as needed, then be sure to initialize
   your development and production databases.

      // development
      $ nv migrate

      // production
      $ NODE_ENV=production nv migrate

3. Run Anvil Connect in development mode

      // with npm script
      $ npm start

      // or directly with node
      $ node server.js

4. Customize the interface by editing /views and adding static assets to /public.

5. Remember to commit your changes.

      $ git commit -m 'My custom authorization server'


You can safely rerun this command without overwriting existing files.
